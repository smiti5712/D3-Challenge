                    <h3>Visualizations Between Healthcare Markers Vs Income and Age</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The data set used for this visualization is from U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates.</p>

                    <p>We can see two clear outliers in the scatter plot of poverty vs lack of healthcare, i.e. Texas and Massachusetts. Texas has a poverty rate of 17.2 % and 24.9 % lack in healthcare whereas Massachusetts has a poverty rate of 11.6 % with
                        4.6% lack in healthcare. <br> Also, as a comparison between Texas and Washington D.C, we can see that even though the poverty % in these states is almost identical, Texas lacks healthcare a lot more. It would be interesting to
                        do additional research on this matter in terms of any health care reforms planned/implemented in these states.<br>We cannot draw any positive or negative correlation between poverty% and lack in healthcare, given that states such
                        as Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Dakota, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming have almost the same poverty rate (~11%), but the lack in healthcare between these states ranges from 4%-15%.</p>

                    <p>In the scatter plot of age vs lack of healthcare, we see that most of the states lack healthcare in 36-40 age range. Again, as a comparison between Texas and Washington D.C, we can see that even though the median age (~34) in these
                        states is very identical, Texas is trailing behind in healthcare. It could be because, the median household income in Washington D.C is about 33% more as compared to Texas, which is visible in the scatter plot between household
                        income and lack in healthcare%, and hence people can spend more towards healthcare.</p>

                    <p>When we shift the view to see a correlation between poverty level vs Obesity%, we see that states with higher poverty% tend to have higher Obesity. Mississippi, with the highest level of poverty also has the highest Obesity%, whereas
                        Hawaii, with a lower poverty level have a fitter population, with less obesity%. </p>

                    <p>Some correlation is also observed between Household income vs Smokers%, we see that states where the median household income is more, those tend to have less smokers as compared to states that have less household income. Similar kind
                        of correlation is observed between Household income vs Obesity%. With the increase in household income, obesity% decreases.</p>
